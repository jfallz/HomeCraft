# HomeCraft
Finally, the most basic feature is now available on Edge.

I made this because I realized you can't set a default new-tab page easily on Edge. You can do this on every other Chromium-based browser, so it is a feature they manually removed to make our lives worse.

## Installation
1. `git clone https://github.com/jfallz/HomeCraft.git`
2. Open up Edge, and go to `edge://extensions`.
3. Click "Load unpacked", and select the `extension` folder within your cloned repository.

You're done!
